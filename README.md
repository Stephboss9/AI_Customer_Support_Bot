### Welcome!

I started this project as part of the Headstarter AI fellowship to learn Next.JS and how to use the OpenAI api. I want to create an AI bot that can help review resumes and provide feedback on various career-related topics.


Here is the current state of the application!

If you would like to try it out on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. In the root folder run: npm install     (assuming you have Node.js installed, if not here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) run
3. Next run: npm run dev, to start the development server
4. Open up: http//localhost:300 in your browser, and whala!
